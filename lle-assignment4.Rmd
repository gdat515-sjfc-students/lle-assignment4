# Picking a Question
While designing a sales contest, the contest planning committee was wondering what an appropriate scale would be for awarding points.  This became the focus of my work for this project. I needed to answer:  During the contest period last year, how many meetings, calls and emails do sales colleagues normally have each week?

# Getting the Data
This data is available through Salesforce reporting but there are limitations to how the information can be retrieved.   In short, each activity (meeting, call, email) for each week (8 weeks total) is reportable, but requires 24 reports (one activity per week at a time).  All reports were downloaded as excel documents, edited to remove headings and extra columns, then saved as .csv.   

# Transformation and Rearrangements
Using R, I combined my .csv files to create the appropriate data tables.   Using R was helpful because full_join() automatically matched up the names of the sales colleagues across all of the tables, putting NA's where the person did not have any data.

I now had three data.tables, one for Meetings, another for Calls and a third for Emails.   Each table has a column with the person's name, followed by 8 columnns with the activity counts for each person for 8 weeks.  I used gather() to create long data tables.   The new data tables have three columns:  the person name, the week, and the activity count.   

# Visualization
At our follow up contest planning meeting I brought 6 graphs.  I started with 3 histograms with 8-week totals for each activity. These three graphs helped the team choose the thresholds for scoring points.  I follwed up by using facet_wrap() to tease out the weekly detail.  This allowed the team to apply their proposed scoring rubric and predict how many people would score points each week.   

I tried many kinds of graphs before ultimately settling on the simple histogram.  I tried box and whisker, but actually found the information was more valuable presented as text next to the histograms.  I also tried geom_density(), geom_dotplot(),  geom_freqpoly() and geom_violin(),   Ultimately, I felt the simple histogram was the most intuitive option.

My final document, shared with the contest planning committee, is enclosed.
